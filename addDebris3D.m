function [ aout, bout ] = addDebris3D( polyA,polyB,debrisStart,debrisThickness )
%ADDDEBRIS3D places a debris layer on top of a given 3D poly file. Inputs are
%the first half of a poly file (i.e. the XYZ coordinates) and the second
%half of a poly file (facet definitions), where you want the debris to
%start, and how thick you want the debris to be at the toe
%16 = bottom facet, 32 = top facet
